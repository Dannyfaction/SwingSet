# SwingSet To and Fro
We had to make a 3D game where the screen output had to be different than a normal screen. We chose the Oculus Rift as we had never used it before and wanted to try it out. We also used the Xbox's Kinect Movement tracker for tracking the movement of our Swing.

We had 2 weeks to finish and set up our project for review, which really went well as our teachers were very positive about it and even send us to the nomination for the Dutch Game Awards
